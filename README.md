# project_euler
## Intro
My attempts at solving the problems from https://projecteuler.net/, this is not the only way to find the solution but what the solution I have come up with. My goal is to practice coding especially in different languages outside the classroom. 

I will often modify the code to be broader and more general (at least for the simpler problems), allowing users to input variables instead of hardcoding the variables from the question.

This page is intended to allow me to document my process for future reference. But if you have found this repository, my code is free to use for personal/non-profit use with credit.
